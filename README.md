<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<!-- Insert image snippet of project -->

<p>
 This project was built by two people, Cyrus Warner and Brandon Calderon, during our time at DevCodeCamp. This was one the one time 
 that Cyrus and me got to work together on a project. It was a great experience pair-programming overall, and if we worked on another 
 project, I'm sure we'd kill it just like we did with this one. We were asked to do the bare minimum with nothing but HTML5/CSS and 
 JavaScript, but we went ahead and implemented more than was necessary because we were a tad bit more advanced than the rest of the 
 the class. Since then, Cyrus and me have gone on to build even more impressive web applications, and we continue to keep in contact. 
 We're hoping to build more web apps together in the near future.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

1. You'll need the latest version of NPM and Visual Studio Code downloaded on your device. (as of September 2021).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   `git clone https://github.com/CyrusWarner/Most-Wanted.git`

2. Install NPM packages
   
   `npm i`

3. Open up terminal in VS Code.
4. `npm start`
5. Enjoy!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The web application was built to look through an array of people within a dataset built within the frontend part of the application. 
It was meant to show us the basics behind CRUD functionality without the use of a database. It was a neat experience for both Cyrus and me 
since we both had minimal exposure to JavaScript as a language before creating this web app. Still, we saw it through, and hopefully you 
are able to mimic the outcome if you're not met with issues upon cloning. Reach out if you're having trouble cloning the web app and I'm 
sure either one of us would be happy to assist you.
